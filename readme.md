## 📘 Overview

The Network Frame Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed for the **analysis and interpretation of network protocol frames**. This project was developed as part of an academic exploration into networking concepts and is aimed at understanding the structure and content of various protocols such as TCP, ARP, ICMP, HTTP, and more.

It provides modular protocol analyzers and includes several frame samples for hands-on experimentation and testing.

## 🧩 Features

- 📦 Modular analyzers for:
  - ARP, RARP, TCP, ICMP, HTTP, Ethernet, DoD Internet protocols, etc.
- 📄 Sample frame files for testing and educational purposes
- 🧪 Text-based input/output for frame simulation and analysis
- 🔧 Utility functions for protocol parsing
